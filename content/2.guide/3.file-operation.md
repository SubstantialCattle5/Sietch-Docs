## File Operations

Once you've set up your Sietch vault, you'll need to know how to work with files inside it. Sietch provides several commands for adding, retrieving, and managing files within your encrypted vault.

---

## Adding Files

### `sietch add`

The `add` command lets you add files or directories to your vault. Files are automatically chunked, encrypted, and stored according to your vault's configuration.

:terminal{content="sietch add ../secrets/thumper-plans.pdf /docs/"}

#### Options:

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `--recursive` | flag | Recursively add directories |
| `--compress` | string | Override default compression |
| `--exclude` | string | Exclude patterns (e.g., `*.tmp`) |
| `--dry-run` | flag | Show what would be added without changes |

::code-group
```bash [Basic Usage]
# Add a single file to the vault
sietch add document.pdf
```

```bash [Add to Path]
# Add a file to a specific path in the vault
sietch add research.pdf /research/
```

```bash [Add Directory]
# Add entire directory recursively
sietch add --recursive ./field-notes/
```
::

::alert{type="info"}
Files added to your vault are immediately encrypted and can only be accessed with your encryption keys.
::

---

## Extracting Files

### `sietch extract`

Extract files from your vault to the filesystem.

:terminal{content="sietch extract document.pdf ./output/"}

#### Options:

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `--output-dir` | string | Directory to extract files to |
| `--preserve-paths` | flag | Maintain directory structure |
| `--overwrite` | flag | Overwrite existing files |

::code-group
```bash [Extract Single File]
# Extract a file to current directory
sietch extract document.pdf
```

```bash [Extract to Directory]
# Extract a file to a specific directory
sietch extract document.pdf ./extracted/
```

```bash [Extract Multiple Files]
# Extract multiple files (supports glob patterns)
sietch extract "research/*.pdf" ./output/
```
::

---

## Decrypting Files

### `sietch decrypt`

The `decrypt` command allows you to decrypt files directly from the vault.

:terminal{content="sietch decrypt thumper-plans.pdf ."}

#### Options:

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `--output` | string | Output file path |
| `--temp` | flag | Decrypt to temporary file |
| `--verify` | flag | Verify file integrity after decryption |

::callout{type="warning"}
#summary
Security Considerations

#content
Decrypted files remain unprotected on your filesystem. Only decrypt files when needed, and consider using secure deletion tools when finished.
::

---

## Listing Files

### `sietch list`

View the contents of your vault.

:terminal{content="sietch list"}

#### Options:

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `--path` | string | List specific path |
| `--format` | string | Output format: `text`, `json` |
| `--recursive` | flag | Show all files recursively |
| `--details` | flag | Show chunk count, size, modified time |

::code-group
```bash [List All Files]
# List all files in the vault
sietch list
```

```bash [List Specific Directory]
# List files in a specific directory
sietch list --path /research/
```

```bash [Detailed Listing]
# Show detailed information about files
sietch list --details
```
::

---

## Advanced File Operations

### `sietch status`

Check the status of files in your vault.

:terminal{content="sietch status"}

This command shows:
- Files staged for sync
- Files with conflicts
- Recently modified files
- Sync status with known peers

---

### `sietch diff`

Compare files across versions or with peers.

:terminal{content="sietch diff document.pdf --peer 192.168.1.42"}

#### Options:

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `--peer` | string | Compare with peer's version |
| `--version` | string | Compare with specific version |
| `--output` | string | Output format: `text`, `json` |

---

### `sietch rm`

Remove files from your vault.

:terminal{content="sietch rm outdated.pdf"}

::list{type="warning"}
- Removes files from the vault index
- Can specify `--purge` to delete chunks (if not used by other files)
- Use `--dry-run` to preview what would be removed
::

---

## File Verification

### `sietch verify`

Verify file integrity within your vault.

:terminal{content="sietch verify research.pdf"}

::alert{type="success"}
This command checks that files match their recorded hashes and that all chunks are present and uncorrupted.
::

## Practical Examples

### Working with Sensitive Documents

```bash
# Add a sensitive document to your vault
sietch add ~/Documents/passport-scan.pdf /identity/

# Verify the file was properly stored
sietch verify /identity/passport-scan.pdf

# Later, extract when needed
sietch extract /identity/passport-scan.pdf ~/temp/
```

### Creating a Research Archive

```bash
# Add a directory of research documents
sietch add --recursive ~/research/desert-ecology/ /research/

# Check what's been stored
sietch list --path /research/ --details

# Sync with a collaborator
sietch sync --peer 192.168.1.42 --paths /research/
```
