# Installation Guide

Before you can defend your data, you need the right tools. Here's how to install Sietch in any environment-urban, rural, disconnected, or hostile.

::alert{type="info"}
Sietch is designed to run on minimal hardware. Even a decade-old laptop or Raspberry Pi can serve as your data fortress.
::

## Prerequisites

::list{type="primary"}

- Operating System: Linux, macOS, or Windows (WSL recommended)
- Go 1.18+: For building from source
- Git: For cloning the repository
- Disk Space: At least 50MB for the binary, plus storage for your vaults

::

Before installing critical security tools like Sietch, verify your system isn't compromised. Consider using a fresh OS installation or dedicated hardware for maximum security.

## Install Methods

### Option 1: Pre-compiled Binaries

The fastest way to get operational:

```sh
curl -sSL https://sietch.io/install.sh
```

Or manually download from our releases page.

### Option 2: Build from Source (Recommended)

For the security-conscious survivor who trusts only code they've verified and compiled:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SubstantialCattle5/Sietch.git

# Enter the directory
cd Sietch

# Build the binary
go build -o sietch ./cmd/sietch

# Move to your PATH (optional)
sudo mv sietch /usr/local/bin/

# Verify the installation
sietch --version

# Expected output
Sietch v0.9.2 - Decentralized vault system
```

::badge{type="success"}
Building from source gives you maximum control and security
::

### First Boot

Once installed, initialize your first vault:

::code-group

```[basic vault]
# Create a basic vault with AES-256 encryption
sietch init --name spice-vault --encrypt aes256
```

```[custom settings]
# Create a vault with custom settings
sietch init --name secure-research \
 --encrypt gpg \
 --key-id your.email@example.com \
 --chunk-size 2MB \
 --compression zstd
```

::

::alert{type="success"}
✅ Your vault is initialized! The directory structure is created and encryption is set up.
::

### Setting Up Encryption

Protect your vault with strong encryption:

::list{type="info"}

- Passphrase: For AES-256 encryption (simpler, faster)
- GPG Keys: For asymmetric encryption (more flexible for teams)

::

```sh
sietch keys generate --type aes256
```

::callout{type="warning"}
#summary
Crucial: Back up your encryption keys

#content
Without your keys or passphrase, your data is permanently lost. Export keys to secure storage, memorize passphrases, or use a trusted password manager. There is no "reset" option.

### Basic Commands Cheat Sheet

#### :icon{name="noto:satellite-antenna"} Syncing

```sh
# Discover peers on LAN
sietch discover

# Add a known peer
sietch peer add 192.168.1.42

# Sync with a peer
sietch sync --peer 192.168.1.42
```

#### :icon{name="noto:key"} Key Management

```sh
# List your keys
sietch keys list

# Export keys (for backup)
sietch keys export --output ./secure/backup.keys

# Import keys (for recovery)
sietch keys import ./secure/backup.keys
```


#### :icon{name="noto:file-folder"} Managing Files
```sh
# List your keys
# Add files to your vault
sietch add /path/to/file.pdf /target/dir/

# List files in your vault
sietch list

# Extract files from vault
sietch extract document.pdf ./output/
```

### Troubleshooting Tips
::list{type="warning"}
- Can't sync? Check your local network, firewall settings, or try direct IP connection
- Slow performance? Adjust chunk size with --chunk-size during vault initialization
- Permission errors? Check file system permissions where your vault is stored
- Network dropping? Enable resilient mode with sietch sync --resilient
::

::alert{type="danger"}
⚠️ If your vault appears corrupted:
Run sietch repair to attempt recovery based on chunk verification. Never delete the .sietch directory!
