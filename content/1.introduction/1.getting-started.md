# Getting Started

Spin up your own encrypted vault in minutes.
No corporate servers. No middlemen. Just your data, your rules.

## Install Sietch

1. Grab the code and build it yourself — trust begins at the source.

```bash [git]
git clone git@github.com:SubstantialCattle5/Sietch.git
cd Sietch
go build -o sietch ./cmd/sietch
```

## Create Your Vault

1. Start fresh. Encrypt everything.

```bash [fish]
sietch init --name spice-vault --encrypt aes256
```

2. *Add files* to your vault:

```bash [sietch]
sietch add ../secrets/thumper-plans.pdf  /docs/
```

3. *Link up* directly — no clouds, no leaks.

```bash [npm]
sietch sync --peer 192.168.1.42
```
