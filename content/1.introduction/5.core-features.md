# Core Features

Sietch is engineered for resilience in the harshest conditions‚Äîwhere internet is unreliable, censorship is real, and survival depends on controlling your own data.  
These are the capabilities that make it possible.

## Detailed Feature Breakdown

### üîí Strong Encryption

Sietch offers configurable encryption built for real-world security:

::list{type="info"}

- **AES-256-GCM:** Fast, authenticated symmetric encryption with passphrase protection.
- **GPG-Compatible:** Public/private key encryption for secure multi-peer collaboration.
- **Chunked encryption:** Each file segment is independently encrypted for granular security.
- **Key management:** Local-only, secure key storage with optional passphrases.
::

::alert{type="success"}
All encryption happens locally‚Äîyour keys and plaintext data never leave your machine.
::

```bash
# Create a vault secured with AES-256
sietch init --name secure-vault --key-type aes --passphrase
```

---

### üì° Offline Sync Capabilities

Designed for environments where the cloud is not an option:

::list{type="info"}

- **Rsync-style delta transfer:** Only changed chunks are moved, saving time and bandwidth.
- **Multiple transports:** Connect over TCP, LibP2P, or physical media (USB drives, SD cards).
- **Resumable syncing:** Interrupted transfers pick up where they left off.
- **Encrypted transport:** Chunks are always encrypted, even in transit.
::

::alert{type="info"}
You can sync directly between devices on a LAN‚Äîno internet required.
::

```bash
# Sync your vault with a peer on your local network
sietch sync --peer 192.168.1.42
```

---

### üß≠ Gossip Discovery Protocol

Finding peers shouldn‚Äôt require setting up infrastructure:

::list{type="info"}

- **LAN auto-discovery:** Vaults find each other automatically over local networks.
- **Manual peering:** Specify trusted peer addresses when needed.
- **Zero-config startup:** Works instantly in trusted environments.
- **Future enhancements:** Planned support for QR code sharing and manual peer bootstrapping.
::

::callout{type="warning"}
#summary
Gossip discovery is for trusted networks.

#content
On public or hostile networks, use manual peer discovery for maximum security.

### ‚öôÔ∏è CLI-First, Scriptable Design

Every aspect of Sietch is designed to be fast, clear, and automation-friendly:

::list{type="info"}

- **Minimal dependencies:** Runs on almost any system with very little overhead.
- **Scriptable workflows:** Easily integrated into custom scripts and automation pipelines.
- **Clear, parseable output:** Designed for both human users and programmatic consumption.
- **Non-interactive mode:** Fully functional in headless or unattended environments.
::

```bash
# Add a file to your vault
sietch add ./secrets/thumper-plans.pdf /docs/

# Sync your vault with a trusted peer
sietch sync --peer 192.168.1.42
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security-Focused Architecture

Sietch‚Äôs defenses are designed against real-world threats:

| Attack Vector        | Mitigation Strategy                                              |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Eavesdropping         | End-to-end encrypted chunks                                       |
| Man-in-the-middle     | Transport encryption via LibP2P TLS                               |
| Unauthorized access   | Cryptographic content verification                               |
| Chunk tampering       | Merkle tree verification for integrity checks                    |
| Replay attacks        | Transport secured with nonces and timestamps                     |
