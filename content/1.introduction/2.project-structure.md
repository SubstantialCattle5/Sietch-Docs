# Project Structure

Sietch is inspired by robust, decentralized systems and provides a resilient, portable vault-built for hostile or disconnected environments.
If you’re familiar with Go, CLI tools, or modern static site generators, you’ll feel right at home.

## Vault Directory Structure

When you initialize a Sietch vault (sietch init), the CLI creates a self-contained directory with everything needed for secure, offline-first storage and sync.
A typical Sietch vault directory looks like:

```bash
.sietch/              # Control room: keys, encryption material, internal state
  keys/               # Encryption keys (AES, GPG, etc.)
  chunks/             # Chunked, encrypted file storage
  sync/               # Sync Keys
  manifest/           # Stores the manifests for all the data stored
vault.yaml            # Manifest: vault ID, encryption, chunking, sync config
```

::alert{type="info"}
Optionally, you can customize the vault location or structure using flags during [sietch init](/).

### Extensibility & Recovery

1. *Manifest & Metadata:*
vault.yaml acts as the genetic map of your vault-future-proofed for new features, sync strategies, and cryptographic extensions.

2. *Recovery:*
Sietch supports rehydration and recovery via CLI (sietch recover), allowing you to rebuild your vault from chunks or peer metadata if your manifest is lost or corrupted.

::alert{type="warning"}
*Sietch* is designed for resilience, security, and portability-whether you’re running a documentation site or a nomadic, encrypted vault.
