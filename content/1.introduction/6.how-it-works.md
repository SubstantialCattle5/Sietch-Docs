## How It Works

Behind Sietch's resilient, survival-first design is a carefully engineered architecture that prioritizes security, offline functionality, and resource efficiency. This page explains the technical components that make your vault reliable even in the harshest conditions.

---

### **Chunking & Deduplication**

Files in Sietch are never stored as monolithic blobs, but intelligently divided into smaller, manageable pieces:

::card{icon=noto:file-folder}
#title
Smart Chunking
#description
Each file is split into chunks using configurable size (default 4MB). This approach enables efficient sync, storage, and recovery-even when connections are unstable.
::

::list{type="info"}
- **Fixed-size chunking**: Predictable, efficient splitting of files
- **Content-defined chunking (CDC)**: Identifies natural boundaries in files for better deduplication
- **Rolling hash algorithms**: Find duplicate chunks across different files
- **Automatic deduplication**: Identical chunks are stored only once
::

```bash
# Example of configuring chunking during initialization
sietch init --name research-vault --chunking-strategy cdc --chunk-size 2MB
```

---

### **Encryption Layer**

Sietch ensures your data remains private through robust encryption systems:

::card{icon=noto:key}
#title
End-to-End Encryption
#description
Each chunk is encrypted before storage with no exceptions. Only authorized parties with the correct keys can decrypt and access your data.
::

::list{type="info"}
- **AES-256-GCM**: Fast symmetric encryption with passphrase protection
- **GPG-compatible**: Public/private key encryption for multi-peer sharing
- **Per-chunk encryption**: Individual encryption of each chunk for maximum security
- **Nonce generation**: Unique nonces prevent identical ciphertexts even for identical content
::

Key Management is Critical

#content
Your encryption keys are the lifeline to your data. Sietch never transmits keys over the network, but you must protect them with strong passphrases and secure backup strategies.
::

### **Peer Discovery**

To function in decentralized environments, Sietch needs robust ways to find other vaults:

::card{icon=noto:compass}
#title
Gossip Discovery Protocol
#description
A lightweight mechanism for vaults to find each other without centralized servers, even in disconnected or local-only networks.
::

::list{type="info"}
- **LAN discovery**: Auto-discovery via UDP broadcast messages
- **Manual peering**: Direct specification of known peer addresses
- **Peer exchange**: Vaults can share information about other known peers
- **Planned features**: Bluetooth, NFC, and QR-code based discovery
::

```bash
# Manually add a known peer
sietch peer add 192.168.1.42
```

::alert{type="info"}
Discovery protocols operate on a zero-trust model. Finding a peer doesn't automatically grant access to vault contents.
::

---

### **Syncing Mechanism**

Once peers are discovered, Sietch uses an intelligent syncing process:

::card{icon=noto:satellite-antenna}
#title
Rsync-Inspired Sync
#description
Efficient, resumable transfer of only the data that's changed or missing between vaults.
::

::list{type="info"}
- **Manifest comparison**: Peers exchange encrypted manifests to identify differences
- **Chunk transfer**: Only missing chunks are requested and sent
- **Resumable transfers**: Sync can pause and continue if interrupted
- **Transport options**:
  - TCP direct connections (fastest, local)
  - LibP2P (most robust, NAT traversal)
  - Sneakernet (physical media transfer for airgap scenarios)
::

```bash
# Manually add a known peer
sietch sync --peer 192.168.1.42
```

---

## Security Flow

Sietch's architecture defends against multiple threats:

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| Passive eavesdropping | End-to-end encryption of chunks |
| Man-in-the-middle | LibP2P TLS transport security |
| Unauthorized access | Content verification via cryptographic hashes |
| Chunk tampering | Merkle tree verification of chunk integrity |
| Replay attacks | Secure transport with nonce/timestamp validation |

#content
The combination of chunking, encryption, discovery, and sync creates a resilient system that can operate in adverse conditions while maintaining security and data integrity. Each component is designed to work independently if needed, providing maximum flexibility.
