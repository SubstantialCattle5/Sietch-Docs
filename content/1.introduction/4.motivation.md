# Motivation

When connection is fragile and privacy isn't optional,  
**Sietch** was built for survival — not convenience.

---

## Why Sietch?

In many parts of the world:

- **Connectivity is a luxury.**  
  Networks fail. Censorship reigns. Surveillance is constant.

- **Privacy is survival.**  
  Sensitive information — research, evidence, identities — must stay confidential at all costs.

- **Mobility is life.**  
  Journalists, activists, researchers: working across borders, on the move, often under pressure.

Most tools assume you're sitting comfortably in Silicon Valley.  
**Sietch doesn't.**

## The Cloud Problem

Modern storage is cloud-first — designed for stable, high-bandwidth internet and centralized trust.

That breaks down fast when:

- Clouds get blocked, surveilled, or attacked.
- Centralized servers become easy targets.
- "Offline mode" is bolted on as an afterthought, if at all.

If you live and work under pressure, you need **survival-first design** — not glossy downtime pages.

## Sietch: Built for Hostile Terrain

Sietch imagines a future closer to **Arrakis** than to **San Francisco**.  
It’s tech for desert-dwellers: tough, resilient, no assumptions about the network.

- **Fully offline by default.**  
  Sync over LAN, direct connection, or sneakernet (USB sticks). Internet? Optional.

- **Decentralized and peer-to-peer.**  
  No cloud. No accounts. Just encrypted vaults moving between trusted hands.

- **Strong encryption, baked in.**  
  Every file is chunked, encrypted, and sealed tight.

- **Portable and robust.**  
  Vaults survive censorship, power cuts, bad networks, and bad actors.

---

##  Who Uses Sietch?

- **Investigative journalists** protecting sources and leaks
- **Human rights defenders** moving sensitive documents across borders
- **Security engineers and ops teams** backing up secrets in airgapped zones
- **Anyone** who refuses to trust their data to the cloud

If survival matters more than convenience,  
**Sietch is your ally.**

**Sietch gives you control — over your data, your privacy, your future.**  
Anywhere. Any network. Or no network at all.
